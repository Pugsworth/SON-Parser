# SON-Parser
A Squirrel Object Notation to JSON parser I cooked up for a personal project. I probably wouldnt use this if you want spec-safe parsing.


This is a good start if you need SON parsing, but keep in mind, this was written in two days and is by no means feature complete or to any spec. It is merely written against my observations of SON while writing in Squirrel for VScripts.

# Usage
I did not write this in any specific format for Nodejs or JS Modules or anything. You can run it simply using `node ./src/parser.js`. Or, you can copy-paste the code into your own project as desired.

# Why?
Practice mostly. I could have probably made a more robust parser using any number of grammar parser generators that exist.
This is for a personal project to have the ability to export data from the game and use it in a client-side web application for processing.

# Contribution?
Please do if you would like to!
Just make a pull request with whatever changes you make and I'll probably approve them if tests pass.
